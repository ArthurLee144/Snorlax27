# Project Title

This project was created by Snorlax27, a group created @ Hack Reactor by Dan, Benji, Yazhi, and Mike. Our project name is Emotisphere, and it is a diary that uses AI technology. We used the Aylien Text API to analyze the text of the user's diary entry, and displayed the analyzed sentiments according to their type (positive, negative, or neutral), and strength. Mike took the role of the product owner, and Yazhi, the scrum master, and Dan and Benji the role of engineers but the distinctions became unclear as we all made concerted efforts to make this fun project work.

## Getting Started

To get started, either you can go to our deployed website https://emotisphere.herokuapp.com/ or use your localhost environment by running babel and node. We are using one of our teammate's mlab database, but if at all that is down, feel free to set your own mongodb connection for your entries to be saved.

### Setting up your localhost

All the dependencies are built into our package json, but you might need to have your node and npx updated for babel and node to run properly.

```
npm install
npm install -g npx
npm install -g node
```

Run these two commands in separate tabs:

```
npm run start
npm run build

```
And access your localhost:8080 :D
