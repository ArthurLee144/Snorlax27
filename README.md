# Snorlax27

# Project Title

This project was created by Snorlax27, a group created @ Hack Reactor by Dan, Benji, Yazhi, and Mike. Our project name is Emotisphere, and it is a diary that has some interesting features attached to it. For example, we used the Aylien Text API to analyze the text of the user's diary entry, and we made the analyzed sentiments (positive/neutral/negative) display colorfully. Check it out as it would be a refreshing experience!

## Getting Started

To get started, either you can go to our deployed website https://emotisphere.herokuapp.com/ or run all the code in a localhost environment by running babel and node. We are using one of our teammate's mlab database, but if at all that is down, feel free to set your own mongodb connection for your entries to be saved.

### Prerequisites

All the dependencies are built into our package json, but you might need to have your node and npx updated for babel and node to run properly.

```
npm install -g npx
npm install -g node
npm install
```

### Installing

Start from the root directory, and run:

```
npm run build
```

, and from another tab of your command line, run:
```
npm run start
```
